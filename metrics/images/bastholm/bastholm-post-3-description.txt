SPLIT DESIGN LAYOUT:
LEFT SIDE (HYPE):
- "HYPE" in large black text (#000000)
- Flashy, abstract elements in light gray outlines
- Wishy-washy visual elements that feel insubstantial
- Represents empty promises and buzzwords

RIGHT SIDE (REALITY): 
- Electric magenta background (#FF00FF)
- "REALITY" in white text (#FFFFFF)
- Solid business elements: clean charts, gears, data visualizations in white outlines
- Represents powerful, real-world AI solutions that actually work
- Pulses with confident energy and substance

ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS:
- Octopus logo integration subtly placed
- High contrast between hype (weak) and reality (strong)
- Premium tech conference aesthetic meets authoritative business presentation

HIPPO BALLOON INTEGRATION:
The grayscale hippo balloon floats subtly behind the split design, adding a whimsical touch that humanizes the serious business message without disrupting the dramatic visual contrast between hype and reality.
