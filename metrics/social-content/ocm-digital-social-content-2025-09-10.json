  "strategy_summary": "This content strategy positions OCM Digital as the liberator from tech dependency, speaking directly to the frustrations of business owners trapped by unresponsive developers and expensive platforms. Each post builds on the core message of ownership and control while addressing different emotional touchpoints: problem recognition (Post 1), shared values (Post 2), and achievable success (Post 3). The content uses relatable scenarios and clear before/after contrasts to make the abstract concept of 'tech ownership' tangible and desirable."
