Start with a pure white background (#FFFFFF) featuring a subtle black and grey hippo balloon floating in the background as a whimsical element. Feature the headline 'AI isn't magic. It's methodology.' in bold, modern sans-serif typography in black (#000000). Create a striking electric magenta (#FF00FF) accent block in the upper third, containing white text (#FFFFFF) that reads 'METHODOLOGY'. Include a clean infographic showing 3-4 practical AI implementation steps with geometric icons in black outlines. Use the electric magenta as strategic accent color for one key element or step number. Add the Bastholm octopus logo subtly integrated. The hippo balloon should be rendered in grayscale (black and grey tones) and positioned subtly in the background to add visual interest without overwhelming the main content. Maintain high contrast throughout with generous whitespace. The design should feel like a premium tech consultancy with electric energy - think Tesla showroom meets creative agency. Composition: Instagram-square format (1080x1080px) with confident, authoritative aesthetic.",

Create a clean before/after comparison with simple progress bars - use black outlines with magenta fill for the 'after' state. Include minimal client logo placeholder in black. Add strategic magenta accent elements to frame key metrics. The hippo balloon should be rendered in grayscale tones and positioned subtly to add visual interest without competing with the main business messaging. The design should feel like a premium consulting firm's success story - confident, results-driven, with that electric energy that demands attention.

Right side: electric magenta (#FF00FF) background with 'REALITY' in white text (#FFFFFF), featuring solid business elements like clean charts and gears in white outlines. Include the headline 'AI hype vs. AI reality: What actually works' at the top in bold black typography. Use the magenta section to represent the powerful, real-world solutions that actually work. Add octopus logo integration. The hippo balloon should be rendered in grayscale and positioned subtly behind the content to add a whimsical touch without disrupting the strong business message. The contrast should be dramatic - the hype side feels wishy-washy while the reality side pulses with confident energy.
