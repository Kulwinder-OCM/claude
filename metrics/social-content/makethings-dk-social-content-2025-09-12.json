The best strategies aren't born in boardrooms. They emerge from real conversations with real people solving real problems.\n\nThat's why I founded MAKE THINGS. Not to build another agency, but to get back to the core of what I love: sitting across from business owners and helping them see their brand's true potential.\n\nEvery framework I use, every workshop I facilitate, every strategy I develop - it all comes back to that human connection.\n\nWhat made you take the leap into your current path?
